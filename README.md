# Electronic_distribution
Based on Thomson's atomic model, distributes the electrons around the atom in order to decrease interactions between them.
Basically the program increments the distance between electrons while stopping them from scaping the atom.

This repo includes two files:

  -Electron.py
  
  -Electron.ipynb

You can execute the first file in your terminal, I recomend this.


You can, however, look at the second file for the code and results.
